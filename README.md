# 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge  
*A lab covering ELK, threat detection, and incident response.*  

---

## **📌 Overview**  
This project documents my experience in building and operating a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) as part of the MyDFIR 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge.
- **Goal**: Build a functional SOC lab with Elasticsearch, Kibana, and simulated attacks.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - **SIEM** using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch + Kibana)
- **Endpoint monitoring** with Elastic Agent + Sysmon
- **Simulated attacks** including brute-force login attempts and command-and-control (C2) activity
