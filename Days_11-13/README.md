## ðŸ“† Days 11â€“13: Brute Force Attacks, SSH Logs & Elastic Agent Deployment

## Day 11: Brute Force Attacks and Detection Attempts

### What Is a Brute Force Attack?

A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to guess login credentials or encryption keys. Attackers automate this process, trying endless combinations until one works.

Itâ€™s repetitive, noisy, and usually easy to detect â€” if you know what to look for.

### ðŸ§± Types of Brute Force Attacks

- **Classic Brute Force**: Tries every possible character combination.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common or leaked passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Attempts known username-password pairs on multiple services.
- **Hybrid Attack**: Combines dictionary words with symbols/numbers.

### ðŸ§° Common Tools

These tools are often used in offensive security, but blue teams also leverage them to test defenses:

- **Hydra**: Supports SSH, FTP, HTTP, and more.
- **Hashcat**: Cracks password hashes using GPUs.
- **John the Ripper**: Combines brute force and dictionary techniques.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway

Brute force attacks persist because weak passwords are still common.  
Knowing the attackerâ€™s tools and methods helps defenders design smarter alerts and simulate attacker behavior internally.

## ðŸ§¾ Day 12: Ubuntu SSH Logs â€“ Real Brute Force Attempts

I deployed a new **Ubuntu Server 24.04** on Vultr and exposed it to the internet to attract activity. After a few hours, I pulled logs using the follwoing command:

```bash
/var/log# grep -i failed auth.log
```
